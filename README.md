# cs141
### All homeworks that were done in cs141:

#### Homework 1
- Involves creating a class hierarchy of shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle) with a base class "Shape," implementing methods to calculate area, print shape details, and draw shapes using character graphics.
- Requires building a linked list-based "Picture" class to manage these shapes, allowing addition, printing, drawing, and area calculation of multiple shapes while following specific formatting and command-line input requirements.

#### Homework 2
- Translating an object-oriented Java program, specifically a class hierarchy involving shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle), into C code without using object-oriented language features.
- Implementing virtual methods, inheritance, and polymorphism manually through vtables and vpointers, simulating the functionality present in the Java program while working within the constraints and structure of the C language.

#### Homework 3
- Implementing a template class Vector, dealing with parameterized abstract data types, and exploring static and dynamic scoping concepts.
- Constructing a Vector class template with specified member functions and methods for deep copying.

#### Homework 4
- Implementing a series of functions in Pure Lisp, focusing on functional programming paradigms and recursion.
- Functions involve list manipulation, such as finding list length, searching for elements, appending lists, reversing, mapping, copying, extracting elements, modifying lists, and performing arithmetic operations on lists representing large numbers.
- Tasks aim to reinforce understanding of recursion, function definition, and list processing in Lisp.

#### Homework 5
- Developing a Lisp interpreter in a subset of Lisp, focusing on evaluation principles and recursion.

#### Homework 6
- Defining various relations and rules from Homework 4, including my_length, my_member, my_append, my_reverse, my_nth, my_remove, my_subst, my_subset, my_add, my_merge, my_sublist, my_assoc, and my_replace.
- Emphasizing the fundamental differences between Prolog's declarative logic paradigm and imperative programming paradigms like Lisp.

#### Homework 7
- Implementing Prolog relations to evaluate arithmetic expressions, simplify polynomials, perform symbolic differentiation, and arrange guests around a round table based on specific constraints.

#### Homework 8 and 9
- Implementing a simulated operating system, 141OS, in Java, focusing on concurrency.
- The system manages user interactions to create, save, and print files, operating on disks and printers as parallel processes while ensuring resource integrity and managing access rights for disk and printer usage.
- Designing classes for users, disks, printers, and managers, simulating the handling of file operations and print requests within the system.
- Homework 8 focuses on implementing a single user, disk, and printer, while Homework 9 extends this to handle interactions from multiple users with various disks and printers, aiming for optimal throughput.
